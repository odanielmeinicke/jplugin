/**
 * The PluginFactory interface provides a comprehensive API for managing the lifecycle,
 * discovery, and retrieval of plugins within the system.
 * <p>
 * This interface is central to the plugin framework and is responsible for:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Retrieving plugin metadata by class reference or by a given name.</li>
 *   <li>Managing collections of {@link PluginHandler} objects both globally and for specific categories.</li>
 *   <li>Accessing instantiated plugin objects if available.</li>
 *   <li>Initializing and interrupting plugins based on various contexts, such as ClassLoader, package name, or Package object,
 *       with an option to process recursively through sub-packages.</li>
 *   <li>Providing a {@link PluginFinder} for advanced discovery operations.</li>
 *   <li>Iterating over all registered plugins through the {@link Iterable} interface and functional-style {@link Stream} operations.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The initialization and interruption methods support different input types (ClassLoader, package name, or Package object)
 * to accommodate various runtime environments. Some methods are marked as experimental to indicate that their API or behavior
 * may change in future versions.
