/**
 * Defines a strategy for initializing classes annotated with {@code @Plugin}.
 * Implementations of this interface are responsible for processing plugin metadata
 * and generating a corresponding {@link PluginInfo} instance that integrates seamlessly
 * with the plugin system.
 * <p>
 * Each implementing class <strong>must</strong> declare a no-argument constructor, which can
 * have any visibility modifier. This ensures that the initialization mechanism can
 * instantiate the class dynamically without requiring external parameters.
 * <p>
 * The primary purpose of this interface is to allow flexible and customizable plugin
 * initialization strategies while maintaining a standardized approach for retrieving
 * plugin-related metadata.
 * <p>
 * Implementations should handle validation, transformation, and dependency resolution
 * when constructing the {@link PluginInfo} instance. Additionally, they should ensure
 * that plugins conform to expected system constraints before being fully initialized.

     * Constructs a {@link PluginInfo} instance using the provided class reference and associated metadata.
     * <p>
     * This method is responsible for extracting and processing plugin-related information,
     * including its name, description, dependencies, and category tags. It ensures that the
     * generated {@link PluginInfo} object accurately represents the plugin's characteristics.
     * <p>
     * If {@code name} or {@code description} are null, implementations should handle these cases
     * appropriately, either by assigning default values or leaving them unset, depending on
     * the intended behavior.
     * <p>
     * Implementations must also verify the validity of dependencies and category tags,
     * ensuring that they conform to any required constraints within the plugin system.

     * @param reference    The class annotated with {@code @Plugin}. This serves as the primary
     *                     reference for identifying the plugin and extracting relevant metadata.
     * @param name         The display name of the plugin. This value may be null if the name
     *                     is not explicitly defined within the annotation or metadata.
     * @param description  A brief description of the plugin's purpose and functionality. This
     *                     value may be null if not explicitly specified.
     * @param dependencies An array of {@link Class} instances representing the dependencies
     *                     required by this plugin. This ensures proper dependency resolution
     *                     before the plugin is initialized. The classes must represent active plugins.
     * @param categories   An array of categories that classify the plugin within the system.
     *                     These categories help in organizing and filtering plugins based on their purpose.
     * @return A ready-to-construct {@link PluginInfo.Builder} instance encapsulating the provided metadata
     *         and initialization details. The returned builder could be built using {@link PluginInfo.Builder#build()} at any moment.
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException If the provided class reference is invalid or does not conform
     *                                  to expected constraints.
     * @throws InvalidPluginException If an error occurs while processing dependencies or
     *                                       retrieving metadata.
